                    So I asked him what he wanted most — what would keep him
                    strong and give him peace.

                    He said,{' '}

                      &quot;I want a home in the woods — somewhere quiet, where
                      I can fight or, if I can&apos;t beat it, die peacefully in
                      my own bed.&quot;

                    I didn&apos;t have the money, but I found a way. I bought a
                    small home in rural Georgia, fixed it up, and gave him
                    exactly what he wished for —{' '}
                    <strong className='text-primary'>peace</strong>. I built him
                    a music room so he could still play, even on his weakest
                    days.

                  <p className='text-foreground leading-relaxed'>
                    He fought hard. But seven months later, just two days before
                    my birthday, he passed away in his sleep — in his bed, in
                    his home, just as he wanted.

                      We live in a world poisoned by greed — chemicals in our

                      Pharma, to access experimental treatments, to support
                      doctors and scientists who truly want to find cures
